From the activity you want to take screenshots or the application class initialise the`Selfie`.\r\n\r\n2. Call `Selfie`'s static methods throughout your app.\r\n\r\nInitialising Selfie\r\n---------------\r\n```java\r\nnew Selfie.Builder()\r\n                .format(\"yyyy-MM-dd_hh:mm:ss\")\r\n                .path(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString())\r\n                .quality(100)\r\n                .build();\r\n```\r\n> - **format**: Any valid date format according to [this](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n> - **path**: The pace where you want to store your image in the device. Defaults to [Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html#getExternalStorageDirectory())\r\n> - **quality**: The quality you want your screenshot to be created. Must be an int between 0 and 100. See [Bitmap Compress](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.html#compress(android.graphics.Bitmap.CompressFormat, int, java.io.OutputStream))\r\n\r\nTaking a screenshot\r\n--------------\r\n```java\r\nSelfie.snap(MainActivity.this);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDownloading\r\n-----------\r\n```groovy\r\ncompile 'uk.co.placona.selfie:selfie:0.0.1'\r\n```\r\n",
